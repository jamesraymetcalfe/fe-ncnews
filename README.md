# Northcoders News Web App

NC News is a reddit style news app built in **React.js** using Material UI components. It is an example of everything I have learned during the front end module of the Northcoders bootcamp, demonstrating my knowledge of subjects including:

- React Virtual DOM
- React Routing
- React Context
- Optimistic Rendering
- Composition
- Error Handling

It is complimentary to the API I built during the back end module, which can be viewed [HERE](https://github.com/jamesraymetcalfe/nc-news). 

## How it works / functionality

My app allows users to: 

- View a range of articles
- Sort these articles by comment count, amount of votes or date created in descending or ascending order
- Select a specific article
- View a list of article comments
- Add and delete their own comments 
- Vote the article up or down

## Take a look

The app is hosted [HERE](https://main--nc-news-jrm.netlify.app/) so please take a look. Feel free to clone the repo ad a look at what is going on under the hood.

Please note, to save you having to sign up and so you can get straight to testing the functionality, a user has been set as default. If you want to change this user head to the user page and pick another. 

If you are having a look behind the scenes...

## Set Up

The project was built using **Node.js V1.5.0** and **NPM v10.2.4**. Instructions for installation can be found [HERE](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Clone the repo

Once Node and NPM are installed, please clone the repo. In the command line run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/jamesraymetcalfe/fe-ncnews.git
